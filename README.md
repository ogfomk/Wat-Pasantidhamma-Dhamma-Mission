# Wat-Pasantidhamma-Dhamma-Mission
Chanting Book 
This is the project of OgFOMK ArTS where we post a chanting book and related 
materials to promote the understanding of the Dhamma according to the  Buddha.

# Phase One:

Part 1 done for Morning Chanting. There are still edits and proofreadings to be accomplished but as this is not for print I am putting it our for those who want to see what is chanted in the morning. I'm moving onto the Evening next.  

# Phase Two:

Once the Wat Pasantidhammaâ€‹ chanting book is copied and edited I will comb this and prepare it for eBooks (Kindle, Kobo, Google Play Books, PDF, etc.) 

# Phase Three:

We will be recording the chants correctly and make available digital audio.

# Phase Four: 

We will do videos of the Chants, Meditation Instructions and Dhamma Talks

# Phase Five: 

Audio of the chanting book released.
