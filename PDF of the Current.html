We wanted to provide a PDF snapshot of the current document. Allas this was not to be had yet at this time. What needs to be done is to put everything together by hand. So the PDF while it was to be a guide must now end up as a final piece.</div>

It will be very time consuming to scan pages, fix the details, compile, collate and then make into a readable document that still will not have digital text. It makes more sense to copy to text by hand and make sure that a new document can be created and shared in as many ways as possible.<br />
<br />
There are also certain parts that do not exists but are referred to in the original document. So to avoid confusion and enhance clarity this future PDF will be more comprehensive and cohesive document.&nbsp;<br />
